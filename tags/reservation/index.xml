      <description>Reserving entity IDs ahead of time can address a bunch of issues in software development and system design, particularly in distributed systems, databases, and applications requiring high concurrency or real-time processing. Here are some of the key benefits and problems that this approach can solve:&#xA;Avoiding Collisions and Ensuring Uniqueness In distributed systems where different nodes generate IDs independently, reserving IDs in batches can prevent collisions. Each node or service can reserve a block of IDs and use them without needing to coordinate with others in real time, ensuring uniqueness across the system.</description>
