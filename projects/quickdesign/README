HTML page Designer

 This is a HTML web page designer, something like a MS FrontPage, but completely browser based and made in Javascript.

 Demo at : http://parth.me/builderjs/

 Quick Start guide :

 Selected elements show a Border.
 use `ESC` key for unselecting elements.

 `Ctrl+Space` to see the HTML code of your page.

 For inserting a new Element, press `i` and then the element name (div/span/a/table etc.) and click Ok.

 `r` - Make element resizable, after resizing, press enter to commit.
 `d` - Make element draggable, after resizing, press enter to commit.
 `c` - Add a new Class to the selected element.

 After changing any CSS property from the East toolbar, press `ENTER` to make it happen.

 A lot more documentation needed.
